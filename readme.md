# Simple Deno Dev-Server Example

Used as a dev tool for running static html sites.     

This simple html server will serve an index.html file and any requests that it generates (style.css, app.js, ...).

## Usage
First, install by running:
```
deno install --global -Af serve.ts
```
This will install it in the .deno folder.

You can then simply type `serve` on the commandline in a folder with an index.html file.
